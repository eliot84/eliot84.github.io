	<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio site, here is a little information about me. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Miami's MFA in Interactive Media, and have a great passion for learning new things. Dolphins are by far my favorite animal, because they are very intelligent animals. When I am not studying code heiroglypics, I am practicing some piano or trying to figure out ways that I can improve my circumstances. My favorite color is burgandy and one day I want to be a millionaire. </p>
